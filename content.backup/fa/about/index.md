من خیلی تنبل هستن که بخوام یه متن رو دو بار بنویسم، پس متن انگلیسی درباره رو همینجا کپی می‌کنم برای آنانکه می‌اندیشند:

I know not much about me or the way I should introduce myself, but the theme I forked from [this chinese guy](https://github.com/elkan1788/hugo-theme-next) requires some about page so, anyways, I sometimes code mostly in python and javascript, I love linux and I do read sometimes. I read literature, politics, economics and finance and philosophy and whatever I find good. That's enouggh. This site is been publuished using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio) and the theme is mentioned above. Nothing else matters.
