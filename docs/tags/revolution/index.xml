Dive into the philosophical insights of Thomas Hobbes, a prominent 17th-century English philosopher, as he explores the complexities of political obedience. Influenced by his experiences during the brutal English civil war, Hobbes emphasizes the importance of submitting to imperfect rulers to prevent chaos and violence. In his renowned work "Leviathan," Hobbes merges the social contract theory with a defense of unwavering obedience, while also cautioning against the dangers of frequent revolutions.
