In the modern world, concentration and focus have taken on the characteristics of a dream or even a fantasy. You’re not alone if you’ve ever felt disoriented or uncoordinated while working on something crucial or even when it came down to life or death. I frequently experience this, therefore over the past several months, I have worked many hours to conquer it by remaining focused and dedicated. Please bear with me while I share some advice with you on how to do the same.

Just like doves. That is all.
I know not much about me or the way I should introduce myself, but the theme I forked from this chinese guy requires some about page so, anyways, I sometimes code mostly in python and javascript, I love linux and I do read sometimes. I read literature, politics, economics and finance and philosophy and whatever I find good.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://linstit.pw/contact/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://linstit.pw/contact/</guid><description>You can reach me via email at me@linstit.pw, this Google Form, or, if you&amp;rsquo;re as lazy as I am, the form below:

&lt;div class="news-lead">
Dante Alighieri (Italian: [ˈdante aliˈɡjɛːri]), probably baptized Durante di Alighiero degli Alighieri[note 1] and often referred to simply as Dante (/ˈdɑːnteɪ, ˈdænteɪ, ˈdænti/,[2][3] also US: /ˈdɑːnti/;[4] c. 1265 – 14 September 1321), was an Italian[a] poet, writer and philosopher.[6] His Divine Comedy, originally called Comedìa (modern Italian: Commedia) and later christened Divina by Giovanni Boccaccio,[7] is widely considered one of the most important poems of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language.
