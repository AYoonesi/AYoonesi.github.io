هم شرقی هم غربی: تاریخ روشنفکری مدرنیته ایرانی by Afshin Matin-Asgari My rating: 4 of 5 stars
پر از جزئیات تاریخی و ارجاعات علمی
برای من زیاد طول کشید تا تموم بشه شاید برای بقیه طول نکشه، اما خب دلیل من برای طول دادن کتاب ارجاعات بسیارشه، کتابی نیست که بشه از ارجاعات بسیارش گذشت، باید ارجاعات موضوعاتی که برام جذاب می‌اومدن رو مطالعه می‌کردم و این حداقل به حجم کتاب 100 درصد اضافه کرد، هرچند ناشی بودن من هم درش بی‌تاثیر نبود
کتابی بود که خیلی ازش لذت بردم، اگر دوستان هم به سیر روشنفکری ایران و اون نقاط کوری که کمتر بهشون پرداخته شده علاقمند هستن بهشون پیشنهاد می‌کنم مقدمه کتاب که شرحی بر فصل‌ها هست رو یک نگاه بندازن، پشیمون نمی‌شن View all my reviews
ورشو ۱۹۲۰: تلاش نافرجام لنین برای چیرگی بر اروپا by Adam Zamoyski My rating: 4 of 5 stars
فصل‌های اول و دوم و آخر پر از مفاهیم تاریخی مناسب عموم هستن اما فصل‌های میانی ممکنه برای کسانی که زیاد به جزئیات لشکرکشی‌های قوا علاقمند نباشن، خسته‌کننده باشه. نتیجه‌گیری جالب اما نادقیقی فصل آخر، من شخصاً خیلی لذت بردم. ترجمه هم عالی هست. View all my reviews
Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much by Sendhil Mullainathan My rating: 4 of 5 stars

فرهنگ سیاسی ایران by محمود سریع‌القلم My rating: 4 of 5 stars
جناب سریع‌القلم و کارهاشون بسیار تأثيرگذار هستند بطورکلی ولی توی ربع این صفحات می‌شد همین مفهوم رو رسوند. ضمنا کتاب حول محور یک موضوع می‌چرخه صرفا درحالیکه مفاهیم اجتماعی-تاریخی عوامل بسیاری درشون دخیل هست. کتاب تلاشی برای نقد و بیان دیگر دیدگاه‌های عقب‌ماندگی در ایران نمی‌کنه و صرفا به ایده نویسنده پرداخته می‌شه. اطلاعات کتاب درباره باقی کشورهای تولیدکننده نفت کمی قدیمی هستند که شاید دلیلش زمان نوشته شدن کتاب بوده باشه؛ علی‌ای‌حال کتابی هست که بعدش نمی‌گید وقتم رو هدر دادم و کاش جاش رفته بودم غازچرانی. دیدگاه نسبتا خوبی در باب کل‌نگری و نقش پدرسالاری در جوامع بطورکلی و نه صرفا ایران به شما می‌ده. ایده جناب مونتسکیو که دیکتاتوری در خانه آموخته شده و در جامعه در سطوح کلان اجرا می‌شه (روح‌القوانین) رو آقای سریع‌القلم به خوبی در ایران شرح دادند که بسیار کار جذابی بود. بعد از خوندن این کتاب احتمالا راغب خواهید شد باقی آثار جناب سریع‌القلم رو هم دنبال کنید هرچند اگر مثل من سریع‌القلم-فن بوده باشید بسیاری جملات، مفاهیم و کلیدواژه‌ها براتون تکراری خواهد بود.

انقلاب مجارستان: مقاومت مردمی علیه توتالیتاریسم by Hannah Arendt My rating: 4 of 5 stars
بالاخره فضای کشور ملتهبه
و آدم بهتره که مسلح به اندیشه باشه تا شعار و آرمان
&mdash;&mdash;
آپدیت پس از پایان کتاب:
کتاب زیبایی هست، بسیار زیبا و کامل، هرچند مسئله انقلاب مجارستان رو اجمالی بررسی می‌کنه و از دیدگاه یک انتلکت و نه یک شهروند و نه حتا یک شهروند مخالف؛ چیزی که من ترجیح می‌دم درموردش بدونم
تحلیلی بسیار جالبی از شخصیت خروشچف ارائه داد که ناشی از شک اطراف چهره نسبتا مثبت خروشچف در ذهن من بود، واقعا لذت بردم
کتاب پا رو از لحاظ تئوریک فراتر از انقلاب مجارستان می‌ذاره، توتالیتاریسم روسی رو بطور اجمالی بررسی می‌کنه و نقد خودش رو بر امپریالیسم روسی نشون می‌ده
این کتاب تاریخ رو روایت نمی‌کنه هرچند شما می‌تونین به سادگی اسامی آشنایی مثل توخاچفسکی یا ژوکوف رو توش ببینید و با استالین و مسئله جانشینی در اتحاد شوروری آشنا بشید
ترجمه قابل‌قبولی بود، دوستان لطف کنن کامنت نذارن ترجمه بد بود و قص علی هذا، چون نشون می‌ده با متون هانا آرنت آشنایی ندارن، که این هم نتیجه بی‌پلاسه
بطورکلی، لذت بردم هرچند لفظ کتاب مناسبش نیست، بیشتر مقاله بود تا کتاب اما من کی باشم به خانوم آرنت نقدی وارد کنم؟

I did not even like this book, just put it here so you would avoid it. Talking to My Daughter About the Economy: or, How Capitalism Works—and How It Fails by Yanis Varoufakis My rating: 1 of 5 stars
Oh wow, it&rsquo;s just really for little girls. I feel like it was a complete waste of time. I hope this kind of bullshit will vanish. Reading it as an intellectual you may realize why Marxism is poison to the world. In fact, you may read it in 2 afternoons since it&rsquo;s too let&rsquo;s say &lsquo;For Kids Only&rsquo; in my opinion. the writer has made sure that the book sells good amongst losers and makes a good fortune. So, leftist economists doing right-wing stuff? Weird world we&rsquo;re living in. Though, not a surprise, Thomas Piketty, also a leftist economist (who I admire) did so. Anyways, after finishing it this afternoon, just imagined how good it was if I could join the Golden Dawn Party of Greece. (:
Cheers. Stay away from leftist populists. View all my reviews

It appears to be a low-cost cruise missile that can be effective when fired in groups. How does it work? How can it be destroyed? While the Kalibr 3M14, a Russian competitor to the American-made Tomahawk missile, costs the Russian military one million dollars (or roughly six million dollars for export), the Iranian Kamikaze drone has a price tag of fewer than twenty-five thousand dollars, which is half the average price of a car in the US and roughly one percent of the Tomahawk price tag. It appears to be a low-cost cruise missile that can be effective when fired in groups.
How Is It Powered? Well, the engine is a four-cylinder Mado MD550 engine, an inferior copy of the German Limbach L550e engine using Chinese parts and assemblies. A similar engine was spotted in Syria in 2014 before. I discovered a Chinese supplier selling each of these engines online for about $17,000. An extremely slow and noisy 50-horsepower civilian engine. Watch the video here to see how noisy it can be:
It makes me think of the German Stuka Siren during World War II. Stuka was originally built this way to disrupt the mindset of the ground forces, but on a modern battlefield, this kind of noise can undermine the effectiveness of the operation.

It turns out that fetching online pages is simple; obtaining useful structured information from them is more difficult. Intro Putting APIs aside, data may also be obtained through scraping web pages. It turns out that retrieving online pages is quite simple, but extrapolating useful, organized information from them is more difficult.
Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re looking for information on a website. Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about Milton friedman! How do you behave? You might, however, copy the data from Wikipedia and put it into your own file. But what if you need a website to provide you with a lot of information as rapidly as possible? Using a website&rsquo;s massive volumes of data to train a machine learning algorithm? Copying and pasting won&rsquo;t work in this circumstance! And at that point, web scraping will be required.
Web scraping employs intelligent automation approaches to get hundreds or even millions of data sets in less time than the tedious and time-consuming process of manually gathering data. So let&rsquo;s explore Web scraping in more detail and learn how to apply it to get information from other websites.
What Is Web Scraping? Web scraping is a computerized technique for gathering copious volumes of data from websites. The majority of this data is unstructured in HTML format and is transformed into structured data in a database or spreadsheet so that it may be used in multiple applications. To collect data from websites, web scraping may be done in a variety of methods. These include leveraging specific APIs, online services, or even writing your own code from scratch for web scraping.
You may access the structured data on many huge websites, like Google, Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, and others, via their APIs. This is the greatest choice, however there are alternative websites that either lack the technological sophistication or don&rsquo;t let users to access significant volumes of structured data. In that case, it&rsquo;s advisable to employ web scraping to get data from the website.
The scraper and the crawler are the two components needed for web scraping. The crawler is an artificial intelligence system that searches the internet for the specific data needed by clicking on links. On the other hand, the scraper is a unique tool designed to extract data from the website. The scraper&rsquo;s architecture might vary significantly depending on the difficulty and size of the project in order to efficiently and precisely extract the data.
HTML Pages on the web are written in HTML, in which text is (ideally) marked up into elements and their attributes:
&lt;html> &lt;head> &lt;title>A web page&lt;/title> &lt;/head> &lt;body> &lt;p id="author">Alireza Yoonesi&lt;/p> &lt;p id="subject">Machine Learning&lt;/p> &lt;/body> &lt;/html> We would be able to extract data using rules like &ldquo;find the p element whose id is topic and return the text it contains&rdquo; in a perfect world where all web pages were semantically marked up for our convenience. HTML isn&rsquo;t often well-formed or annotated in the real world. Thus, we will require assistance in understanding it.
The Beautiful Soup package, which creates a tree out of the various components on a web page and offers a straightforward interface for accessing them, will be used to extract data from HTML. We&rsquo;ll be using Beautiful Soup 4.11.1 (April 8, 2022), which is the most recent version as of this writing. We’ll also be using the Requests library, which is a much nicer way of making HTTP requests than anything that’s built into Python.
Python’s built-in HTML parser is not that lenient, which means that it doesn’t always cope well with HTML that’s not perfectly formed. For that reason, we’ll also install the html5lib parser.

As a teenager with more reasons to study hard, I went to a school that needed an entrance exam that appeared tough at first sight but was not too difficult if you studied a little. It was called a branch of “Sampad” which was the short form for The National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents in Persian. A haven for genius, ideally, but dreams never prove true, do they? This is the story behind my past: My arguments for why no one has the right to call my niece intelligent!
As usual, Manifesto If we divide all people based on their social/economic status into two groups of individuals with Professional (such as lawyers) and Semi-Professional (such as Uber drivers) occupations, we see a significant variation in how these people describe things such as values and expectations.
If you question a truck driver, for example, he or she will most likely insist on outward qualities such as obedience, courtesy, and order. If you ask the same question to a Harvard professor, you will encounter characteristics such as curiosity, pleasure, and cognitive and social maturity. This is one aspect that may influence how these varied parents bond with their children, which usually leads to higher educational objectives.
According to studies conducted between 2002 and 2008, these “Upper-Class” kids are more likely to be involved with alcohol or drugs (such as amphetamine), and the rate of depression among them is extremely high. Furthermore, there was a correlation between drugs and depression and anxiety, leading the researchers to conclude that these students utilized the drugs to treat their depression, resulting in greater and worse drug addiction in the future.

The Problem With People One of the issues I have with individuals is that they hardly read. And when they do read, it is usually for titles that aren’t worth their time. This stinks, people, read excellent stuff. In this world, we don’t have much time. I don’t want to waste any more of it on poor books. In any case, I will not be counseling anyone.

In my country, there is a misconception that All doctors are so brilliant or, even more ridiculously, that Doctors are wiser than others. Today, I want to put this myth to the test. Manifesto: Question Description Imagine there is a particular illness called the D, and we have 8 D positives out of every 10,000 people; with a test that is 99% accurate (to clarify, Rapid Covid tests are believed to be 70% reliable/Source). What does a positive test signify in this situation? Let me illustrate; Joe had always known that in medical diagnostics, a positive test signifies you have the disease, a test result means you are not infected, and so on. In fact, a positive is undesirable, and we prefer negatives. Our Joe was walking down the street one day when he came across a banner that read: FREE D TEST! He thought to himself, “If it’s free, I’ll do it.” He received the results after a week. He was both astonished and terrified (D was incurable) because the test did not yield the desired findings! Joe couldn’t tell his family or even his partner about it (can you guess why?).

Though the pricing is too little for an ordinary US citizen, where I come from (Iran) 5 bucks a month is something you cannot pay easily putting its value aside.

The New Life Much of the life of Dante Alighieri is obscure, and the known facts are surrounded by a haze of legend and conjecture. He was born in Florence in 1265, of a family noble but not wealthy. His early education is a matter of inference, but we know that he learned the art of writing verse from the poets of France and Provence, and that after he reached manhood he devoted much time to study and became profoundly learned. As a young man he saw military service; and he married some time before he was thirty-two. In Dante&rsquo;s day politics in Florence were exciting and dangerous; and after a few years of participation in public affairs he was condemned to death by his political enemies in 1302. He saved himself by exile, and never returned to his native town. The rest of his life was mainly spent wandering about the north of Italy, in Verona, Bologna, Pisa, Lucca, and finally Ravenna, where he died in 1321. During the years of his exile he found generous patrons in men like the heads of the Scala family in Verona and Guido NovcUo da Polenta in Ravenna; and at Bologna and elsewhere he was welcomed as a teacher. In the early part of the century in which Dante was born, the literary language of Tuscany was still Latin, and not the least of his services to his country was his influence in finally establishing the dignity of Italian as a medium for great literature. He himself used Latin in at least three works: his lecture &ldquo;De Aqua et Terra&rdquo;; his &ldquo;De Monarchia,&rdquo; in which he expounded his political theory of the relation of the Empire and the Papacy; and his unfinished &ldquo;De Vulgari Eloquentia,&rdquo; containing his defense of the use of Italian. More important, however, were his two great works in the vernacular, the &ldquo;Vita Nuova,&rdquo; a series of poems with prose commentary, on his love for Beatrice, and the &ldquo;Divina Commedia.&rdquo;
Bice The Beatrice, real or ideal, who plays so important a part in the poetry of Dante, is stated by Boccaccio to have been the daughter of Folco Portinari, a rich Florentine, and wife of the banker Simone dei Bardi. With this actual person Dante&rsquo;s acquaintance seems to have been of the slightest; but, after the fashion of the chivalric lovers of the day, he took her as the object of his ideal devotion. She became for him, especially after her death in 1290, the center of a mystical devotion of extraordi- nary intensity, and appears in his masterpiece as the personification of heavenly enlightenment.
Dante and Beatrice, by Henry Holiday (1883). Dante looks longingly at Beatrice (in center) passing by with friend Lady Vanna (red) along the Arno River Divine Comedy The &ldquo;Divine Comedy&rdquo; was entitled by Dante himself merely &ldquo;Comediia,&rdquo; &ldquo;meaning a poetic composition in a style intermediate between the sustained nobility of tragedy, and the popular tone of elegy.&rdquo; The word had no dramatic implication at that time, though it did involve a happy ending. The poem is the narrative of a journey down through Hell, up the mountain of Purgatory, and through the revolving heavens into the presence of God. In this aspect it belongs to the two familiar medieval literary types of the Journey and the Vision. It is also an alle- gory, representing under the symbolism of the stages and experiences of the journey, the history of a human soul, painfully struggling from sin through purification to the Beatific Vision. Other schemes of interpre- tation have been worked out and were probably intended, for Dante granted the medieval demand for a threefold and even fourfold signifi- cation in this type of writing. But the &ldquo;Divine Comedy&rdquo; belongs to still other literary forms than those mentioned. Professor Grandgent has pwinted out that it is also an encyclopedia, a poem in praise of Woman, and an autobiography. It contains much of what Dante knew of theology and philosophy, of astronomy and cosmography, and fragments of a number of other branches of learning, so that its encyclopedic character is obvious. In making it a monument to Beatrice, he surpassed infinitely all the poetry devoted to the praise of women in an age when the deification of women was the commonplace of poetry. And finally he made it an autobiography — not a narrative of the external events of his life, but of the agony of his soul.
Dante, poised between the mountain of purgatory and the city of Florence, displays the incipit Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita in a detail of Domenico di Michelino's painting, Florence, 1465 He that dies this year is quit for the next / William Shakespeare Thus, in an altogether unique way, Dante summarizes the literature, the philosophy, the science, and the religion of the Middle Ages. Through the intensity of his capacity for exfjerience, the splendor of his power of expression, and the depth of his spiritual and philosophic insight, he at once sums up and transcends a whole era of human history. Dante&rsquo;s final days were spent in Ravenna, where he had been invited to stay in the city in 1318 by its prince, Guido II da Polenta. Dante died in Ravenna on 14 September 1321, aged about 56, of quartan malaria contracted while returning from a diplomatic mission to the Republic of Venice. He was attended by his three children, and possibly by Gemma Donati, and by friends and admirers he had in the city. He was buried in Ravenna at the Church of San Pier Maggiore (later called Basilica di San Francesco). Bernardo Bembo, praetor of Venice, erected a tomb for him in 1483.
On the grave, a verse of Bernardo Canaccio, a friend of Dante, is dedicated to Florence:
