# I am a developer
> *I suffer therefore I exist.*

من خیلی تنبل هستم که بخوام یه متن رو دو بار بنویسم، پس متن انگلیسی درباره رو همینجا کپی می‌کنم برای آنانکه می‌اندیشند:

<div>
<div class="site-author-image" style='max-width: 99%; border: none;'>

![Some dove on my about page](/img/me-dove.webp "Some dove on my about page")

</div>
</div>

 > *<h2>Just like doves. That is all.</h2>*

I know not much about me or the way I should introduce myself, but the theme I forked from [this chinese guy](https://github.com/elkan1788/hugo-theme-next) requires some about page so, anyways, I sometimes code mostly in python and javascript, I love linux and I do read sometimes. I read literature, politics, economics and finance and philosophy and whatever I find good. That's enouggh. This site is been publuished using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio) and the theme is mentioned above. Nothing else matters.
P.S.: I write to stay sane.

I develope Python programs, mostly web apps backend (Django, Flask & FastAPI) and Artificial Intelligence(AI, ML, DS). Somedays I do use JavaScript and NodeJS (mostly express and nuxt) but it's not my cup of tea. I know some C++ and I have experience in Linux servers (doing devops things). I'm available remotely cuze I live in Iran. (:
