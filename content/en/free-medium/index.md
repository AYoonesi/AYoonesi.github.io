## Why read Medium?
Reading medium articles is an excellent way to learn about new topics or to keep up with current events. When you read a medium article, you’re getting the opinion of the author as well as the information they’ve gathered. This can make it easier to decide whether or not you want to learn more about the topic. <br/>
In addition, medium articles are often shorter than traditional articles. This makes them more suitable for quick reading. If you have time, you can read the entire article, but reading only a few paragraphs is often enough.<br/>
Medium also offers a variety of different reading experiences. If you’re looking for a more personal read, you can read the articles on the website itself. If you’d like to read more articles like this, you can also subscribe to a Medium newsletter. This way, you’ll be notified when new articles are published.<br/>
Reading medium articles is a great way to stay up to date on the current happenings. Medium has provided an active community for folks around the world to share their insights on the world and find audiences for their stories. Writing and of course, reading in Medium increases your productivity and allows you to look at events around the world from a different lens.
