## With no special order:
I have done not too many projects, but the few are listed down here:
- **Get Unlimited Medium Articles Using Python ([GutHub Source](https://github.com/AYoonesi/flask-free-medium) | [App](https://freemedium.info/app/))** <br/>
    I personally always loved reading, but the problem with reading as a hobby is that you may only have access to some ideas mainly from Scholars or Journalists (or someone else but you get the idea, right?) that ‘MAY’ promote their initial ideas or beliefs with some kind of trick, like supporting a wrong statement with some Psychological experiment done decades ago.

- **Instagram Profile Get for Telegram ([GutHub Source](https://github.com/AYoonesi/instagram-profile-get))** <br/>
    A simple project that fetches IG profiles in HD quality, it gained no serious attention on the Internet, so I just deleted the repository on my servers. But the source code is available. It could be easily used with flask, too. Just delete the Telegram options and add Flask to it. Simple.

- **Hugo Theme That My Site Uses ([GutHub Source](https://github.com/AYoonesi/persian-hugo-theme))** <br/>
    A theme translated to Persian. [Main Theme Here](https://github.com/elkan1788/hugo-theme-next)

- **My Medium Things ([GutHub Source](https://github.com/AYoonesi/medium))** <br/>
    I put my Medium articles' files here. Mostly Jupyter notebooks. For example [this article](/post/shakespeare/) on Shakespeare. Anyways. <br/>

- **YouTube WordCloud with Flask in Python ([GutHub Source](https://github.com/AYoonesi/yt-cloud) | [App](https://yt-cloud.herokuapp.com/))** <br/>
    The idea is creating wordcloud for YouTube videos, and then Medium articles as well. I copied the idea from [this guy](https://www.param.me/videocloud/) btw. I used word_cloud from PyPi, lots of thanks to [amueller](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) for his effort on this project. It produces something like this out of YouTube videos:
