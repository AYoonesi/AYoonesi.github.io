## The Idea

Let me start my first article on Medium by describing my own problem; I personally always loved reading, but the problem with reading as a hobby is that you may only have access to some ideas mainly from Scholars or Journalists (or someone else but you get the idea, right?) that ‘MAY’ promote their initial ideas or beliefs with some kind of trick, like supporting a wrong statement with some Psychological experiment done decades ago.

This problem is somehow not a problem anymore with the existence of the Internet and its popularity rising every single day. Nowadays you could write almost for free on services like Wordpress.com or Blogger.com but the best system, in my opinion, is Medium.com, which is free to write but not free to read. Though the pricing is too little for an ordinary US citizen, where I come from (Iran) 5 bucks a month is something you cannot pay easily putting its value aside. We are sanctioned, so paying is not an easy option. But every system has different features you could use, right?
