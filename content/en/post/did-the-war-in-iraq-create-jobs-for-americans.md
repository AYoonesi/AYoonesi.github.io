## Intro?

My favorite [*Outline Generator*](https://h-supertools.com/ai/article-outline-generator) (Hasan Aboul Hasan’s tool that uses AI to produce outlines for my articles) proposes that I talk about the conflict itself and describe what it was like, etc. I’m assuming you already know everything, and I’d like to examine everything through the lens of macroeconomics. This question was posted on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-war-in-Iraq-create-jobs-for-Americans), and it made me think deeply because all of the answers were things like *YES, IT DID CERTAINLY*, and I was **surprised!**

## The Problem With People

One of the issues I have with individuals is that they hardly read. And when they do read, it is usually for titles that aren’t worth their time. This stinks, people, read excellent stuff. In this world, we don’t have much time. I don’t want to waste any more of it on poor books. In any case, I will not be counseling anyone. I begin my talk with a simple question: Have you read Frédéric Bastiat’s [*That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Not Seen?*](http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html) Obviously not. Let me illustrate this with an example.
