This is the story behind my past: My arguments for why no one has the right to call my niece intelligent!

<!--more-->

As a teenager with more reasons to study hard, I went to a school that needed an entrance exam that appeared tough at first sight but was not too difficult if you studied a little. It was called a branch of “Sampad” which was the short form for *The National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents* in Persian. A haven for genius, ideally, but dreams never prove true, do they? This is the story behind my past: ***My arguments for why no one has the right to call my niece intelligent!***

## As usual, Manifesto

If we divide all people based on their social/economic status into two groups of individuals with Professional (such as lawyers) and Semi-Professional (such as Uber drivers) occupations, we see a significant variation in how these people describe things such as values and expectations.

If you question a truck driver, for example, he or she will most likely insist on outward qualities such as obedience, courtesy, and order. If you ask the same question to a Harvard professor, you will encounter characteristics such as curiosity, pleasure, and cognitive and social maturity. This is one aspect that may influence how these varied parents bond with their children, which usually leads to higher educational objectives.

According to studies conducted between 2002 and 2008, these “Upper-Class” kids are more likely to be involved with alcohol or drugs (such as amphetamine), and the rate of depression among them is extremely high. Furthermore, there was a correlation between drugs and depression and anxiety, leading the researchers to conclude that these students utilized the drugs to treat their depression, resulting in greater and worse drug addiction in the future.
