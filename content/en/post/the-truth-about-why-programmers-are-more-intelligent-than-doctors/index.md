## Manifesto: Question Description

Imagine there is a particular illness called the D, and we have 8 D positives out of every 10,000 people; with a test that is 99% accurate (to clarify, Rapid Covid tests are believed to be 70% reliable/Source). What does a positive test signify in this situation? <br/>
Let me illustrate; Joe had always known that in medical diagnostics, a positive test signifies you have the disease, a test result means you are not infected, and so on. In fact, a positive is undesirable, and we prefer negatives. Our Joe was walking down the street one day when he came across a banner that read: FREE D TEST!<br/>
He thought to himself, “If it’s free, I’ll do it.” He received the results after a week. He was both astonished and terrified (D was incurable) because the test did not yield the desired findings! Joe couldn’t tell his family or even his partner about it (can you guess why?).<br/>
