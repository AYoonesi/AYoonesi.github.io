L' Instit refers to the last time I was truly happy. (:

L' instit (The School Teacher) portrayed by Gerard Klein (Victor Novak) is a character of pure fiction. A Knight Rider 2000 for students, he always arrives on his motorbike, and you are sure he will solve all the problems around and maybe more.
